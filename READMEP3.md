# MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, React, NodeJS) implementation
 
### My Learnings
* NodeJS is a server side JS web server that runs ExpressJS(JS on the server side) and npm is the package manager for NodeJS.
* Mongoose is a node package that makes it easy for Node applications to communicate with MongoDB
 
### Struggles
* Struggled with editting file when I used vi as the backspace did not delete text instead just moved cusor so I used nano to edit the the api.js(routes) when it needed updating after the models were created.
 
* I could not delete record in Mongo DB, screen shot attached
 
* Got an error when I tried to create the FE i.e reactJS, saying that my version of node was lower than expected. Used commands below to rectify it.
   `npm cache clean -f
npm install -g n
sudo n stable`
 
### Feedback On Project 3
* So when the node application is started up in AWS, one can not put in more commands in that terminal window so it may be worth adding a text in the study notes to tell the guys to open a new terminal tab and SSH again to continue with the steps.
 
### Questions
 
* Working as a DevOps engineer, do I need to know how a what each line for examole in the api.js file does or usually is this built with a node developer sat next to the DevOps engineer?
